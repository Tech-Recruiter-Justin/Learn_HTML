## What is HTML5 and who decides the changes of HTML? ##
- HTML5 is the HTML but with a bunch of newer features i.e. 2D/3D graphs, performance improvement etc.
- HTML Standard defines how HTML should behave
- Browsers actually respect those rules and implement HTML in their application based on what was written
- You don't need to install HTML5 at all like some other programming languages
- <!DOCTYPE html> actually indicates HTML5 is being used to the browser
- There is no way to disable HTML5 if you have an updated Chrome/ whatever browser supporting HTML5
