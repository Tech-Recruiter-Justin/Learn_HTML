    <h1>Mechanical Keyboard</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Computer keyboards</b> can be classified by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch">switch</a> technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric
        keyboards
        typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects
        key
        response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key
        to
        enter a character reliably). Some newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater
        cost savings.

    <h2>Types</h2>

    <h3>Buckling-spring keyboard</h3>
    <p>
        Many typists prefer buckling spring keyboards.[17] The buckling spring mechanism (expired U.S. Patent 4,118,611
        )
        atop the switch is responsible for the tactile and aural response of the keyboard. This mechanism controls a
        small hammer
        that strikes a capacitive or membrane switch.[18] In 1993, two years after spawning Lexmark, IBM transferred its
        keyboard
        operations to the daughter company. New Model M keyboards continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until
        1999, when
        Unicomp purchased the keyboard technology. Today, new buckling-spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp.
        Unicomp also
        repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards.

    <h3>Hall-effect keyboard</h3>
    <p>
        Hall effect keyboards use magnets and Hall effect sensors instead of switches with mechanical contacts. When a
        key is
        depressed, it moves a magnet that is detected by a solid-state sensor. Because they require no physical contact
        for
        actuation, Hall-effect keyboards are extremely reliable and can accept millions of keystrokes before failing.
        They are
        used for ultra-high reliability applications such as nuclear power plants, aircraft cockpits, and critical
        industrial
        environments. They can easily be made totally waterproof, and can resist large amounts of dust and contaminants.
        Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key, as well as custom control electronics, they are expensive
        to
        manufacture.

    <h2>Debouncing</h2>

    <p>
        When a key is struck, it oscillates (or bounces) against its contacts several times before settling. When
        released,
        it oscillates again until it reverts to its rest state. Although it happens on such a small scale as to be
        invisible
        to the naked eye, it is sufficient for the computer to register multiple key strokes inadvertently. To resolve
        this
        problem, the processor in a keyboard "debounces" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one
        "confirmed"
        keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact. Early membrane keyboards had limited
        typing
        speed because they had to do significant debouncing. This was a noticeable problem on the ZX81.[citation needed]
